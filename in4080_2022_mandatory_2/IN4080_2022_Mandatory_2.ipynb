We will combine some of the tools for tagging from NLTK with scikit-learn to build various taggers.We will start with simple examples from NLTK where the tagger only considers the token to be tagged---not its context---and work towards more advanced logistic regression taggers (also called maximum entropy taggers). Finally,  we will compare to some tagging algorithms installed in NLTK.\n",
